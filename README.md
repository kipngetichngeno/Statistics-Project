REPORT 
Sales Performance & Decision Making Using Statistics
1. Executive Summary
This report presents a statistical analysis of sales transaction data from a retail company operating both online and physical stores across multiple regions.
The objective was to evaluate sales performance, understand variability and reliability of insights, and determine whether a marketing campaign increases average revenue per transaction.
Using descriptive statistics, data visualization, sampling theory, probability concepts, and hypothesis testing, the analysis provides statistically sound insights to support business decision-making.
The results indicate that revenue performance is variable, positively skewed, and significantly influenced by marketing campaigns. Practical business recommendations are provided based on statistical evidence.

2. Key Insights from the Analysis
2.1 Revenue Performance and Central Tendency

Analysis of monthly revenue revealed differences between the mean, median, and mode:

. The mean revenue was influenced by extreme high-revenue months.
. The median represented the typical revenue more accurately.
. The mode was not meaningful due to the continuous nature of revenue data.

Insight:
Monthly revenue contains outliers, often caused by promotions, seasonal demand, or bulk purchases. 
As a result, the median provides a more reliable representation of normal performance.

2.2 Revenue Variability and Stability
Measures of dispersion (range, variance, and standard deviation) showed that revenue fluctuates substantially across time and regions.
Insight:
A high standard deviation indicates unstable sales patterns. 
This suggests that revenue is sensitive to external drivers such as marketing campaigns, seasonality, and store location.

From a business perspective, high variability increases forecasting risk and complicates inventory and budgeting decisions.

2.3 Distribution Shape and Revenue Behavior

The histogram of revenue showed a positively skewed distribution:

. Most transactions generate moderate revenue.
. A small number of transactions generate exceptionally high revenue.

Insight:
Positive skewness confirms that extreme values pull the mean upward. 
The distribution also displayed high kurtosis, indicating heavy tails and the presence of extreme revenue events.

This reinforces the importance of using robust statistics (such as the median) in performance reporting.

2.4 Visualization Insights

Multiple visualizations were used to explore patterns:
.Line chart (Revenue over time): Showed clear trends, seasonal spikes, and campaign-related increases.
.Bar chart (Revenue by store type): Indicated that online stores contribute significantly to total revenue, suggesting scalability and growth potential.
.Box plot (Revenue by region): Highlighted regional differences in consistency and the presence of outliers.
.Scatter plot (Marketing spend vs revenue):Revealed a positive relationship between marketing investment and revenue, although returns may diminish at higher spending levels.

Insight:
Revenue performance is not uniform and is strongly influenced by store type, region, and marketing activity.

3. Statistical Decisions and Inference
3.1 Sampling and Bias Considerations
Population: All sales transactions across all stores and regions.
Sample: The subset of transactions analyzed.

When assuming that only urban stores were sampled, the analysis identified selection bias.

Statistical Decision:
Urban-only sampling overestimates revenue performance and limits generalizability.

Corrective Action:
A stratified random sampling approach is recommended to ensure proportional representation across regions, store types, and locations.

3.2 Law of Large Numbers
As sample size increased, sample means converged toward the population mean.

Statistical Insight:
Small samples produce unstable estimates, while larger samples yield more reliable and consistent averages.
Decision:
Business conclusions should be based on sufficiently large datasets to minimize random variation.

3.3 Central Limit Theorem
By drawing multiple samples of size 30, the distribution of sample means approximated a normal distribution despite the skewed nature of revenue data.
Statistical Decision:
The Central Limit Theorem justifies the use of parametric tests, such as the t-test, for revenue analysis.

3.4 Hypothesis Testing: Marketing Campaign Effect
Business Question:
Does running a marketing campaign increase average revenue per transaction?
Hypotheses:

H₀: Mean revenue (campaign) = Mean revenue (no campaign)
H₁: Mean revenue (campaign) > Mean revenue (no campaign)

Test specifications:
One-tailed t-test
Confidence level: 95%
Alpha (α): 0.05

Result:
The p-value obtained from the t-test was less than 0.05.

Statistical Decision:
Reject the null hypothesis.
Inference:
There is statistically significant evidence that marketing campaigns increase average revenue per transaction.

3.5 Errors and Risk Interpretation
Type I Error: Concluding the campaign works when it does not, leading to wasted marketing resources.
Type II Error: Concluding the campaign does not work when it actually does, resulting in missed revenue opportunities.
Insight:
Given the competitive retail environment, Type II errors may be more costly due to lost growth potential.

3.6 Effect Size and Power

Cohen’s d indicated a medium effect size, suggesting that the campaign impact is not only statistically significant but also practically meaningful.

Power Consideration:
An insignificant result may still have business relevance if the sample size is small or variability is high.

4. Business Recommendations

Based on the statistical findings, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. Use median revenue for performance reporting to avoid distortion caused by extreme values.
2. Improve sales stability through diversified campaigns and better demand forecasting.
3. Continue and scale marketing campaigns, as they show statistically significant and meaningful revenue impact.
4. Adopt stratified sampling methods for future analyses to avoid bias and improve representativeness.
5. Increase data collection and sample sizes to improve statistical power and confidence in decisions.
6. Invest further in online sales channels, which demonstrate strong and scalable revenue performance.
7. Monitor diminishing returns on marketing spend to optimize budget allocation.

5. Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how statistical methods can be applied to real-world business problems to support evidence-based decision-making.
Through descriptive statistics, visualization, probability theory, and hypothesis testing, the company gains reliable insights into revenue behavior and marketing effectiveness.
The findings confirm that marketing campaigns positively influence revenue, while also highlighting the importance of proper sampling, variability management, and effect size interpretation. 
Implementing the recommended actions will enable the company to make more informed, confident, and profitable strategic decisions.
